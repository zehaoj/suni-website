        <h1>Privacy Policy for Suni Weather App</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: Jan 2026</strong></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Suni ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use the Suni weather application ("the App").</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Location Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>City Coordinates</strong>: When you add a city to the App, we store the city name and its geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) that you provide or select.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: We use location coordinates solely to fetch weather data for the cities you choose to monitor.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage</strong>: City data is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults and App Groups (for widget functionality).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weather Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cached Weather Information</strong>: The App caches weather data locally on your device to improve performance and reduce network usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Cached data allows the App to display weather information quickly and function offline.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Weather data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>App Usage Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>City Preferences</strong>: We store your list of selected cities, their order, and display preferences locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings</strong>: Your app settings (temperature units, distance units, etc.) are stored locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <li>Cache data locally to reduce network requests</li>
            <li>Enable widget functionality to display weather on your home screen</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
